The Repository contains 3 folders:
--
->The Project report which is an overall summary report of the research which we conducted in this project. We recommend a reading of this report before looking at the content in the folders
--
->part1 - Presentation & Code (Proofs) for Simple Imperative Programs using Principles of IMP.
--
->part2 - Presentation & code (Proofs) for Small Step Operational Semantics and its importance towards Parallel Computation.
--
->part3 - Presentation for Simply Typed Lambda Calculus and demonstrations of its Principles using proofs in Coq (Code).
